					I am a computer engineering researcher and software developer with
					expertise in blockchain technology and distributed systems. I obtained
					my Ph.D. from the
					<a
						href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University</a
					>
					in 2024, supervised by
					<a
						href="https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ozturaca/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>Prof. Can Özturan</a
					>, and my M.Sc. in
					<a
						href="https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>Computer Science from Binghamton University (SUNY)</a
					>
					in 2015, supervised by
					<a
						href="https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~ghose/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>Prof. Kanad Ghose</a
					>. Currently, I served as a Part-time Lecturer at Boğaziçi University
					during the 2025 spring semester, where I taught "Functional
					Programming and Verification" to senior undergraduate students and was
					selected as the best lecturer by student ratings.

					Broadly speaking, my research belongs to the areas of blockchain
					technology and distributed systems, fields that are rapidly evolving
					and require significant research community effort to realize the next
					generation of autonomous computational platforms. My research focuses
					on developing autonomous blockchain-based computational brokers for
					e-Science applications, ensuring trust and transparency in distributed
					computational processes through smart contracts. I have focused on
					three main thrusts, including Blockchain Technology (e.g., smart
					contracts, distributed systems, computational brokers), e-Science
					Applications (e.g., workflow management, resource allocation, trust
					mechanisms), and distributed computing (e.g., autonomous systems,
					performance optimization).
				</p>

				<p>
					I have published research in top-tier venues including Cluster
					Computing (Springer), Concurrency and Computation: Practice and
					Experience (Wiley), and IEEE conferences. I have served as a reviewer
					for several international journals and conferences. Additionally, I
					have actively contributed to the developer community through Stack
					Overflow, where I have asked and answered numerous questions, reaching
					millions of people and helping the programming community. 					I have also
					developed the full package for <a href="https://github.com/ebloc/ebloc-broker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">eBlocBroker</a>, including smart contracts and other related components, a blockchain-based autonomous computational resource broker for e-Science, which I enjoyed implementing over the years. I am
					committed to advancing the field through both theoretical
					contributions and practical implementations that can benefit the
					broader research community and industry applications.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Hobbies:</strong> I enjoy gaming and have spent hundreds of hours exploring various games on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198803169164/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>, where I take pleasure in thoroughly exploring each game's mechanics and storylines.
